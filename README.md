Got it! Here's the updated version with the clarification that the SSH or HTTPS clone URL applies to the **user's repository**, not this project:

# 🚀 GitHub-Made-Simple: Git Without the Grit!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/potterheadk/github-made-simple.git
cd github-made-simple
```

### **Important for Your Repository**:
When using this tool for your own repository, you **must** clone your repository using the correct URL format:
- For **SSH access**, you **must** clone the repository using the SSH URL format:  
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
  ```
- For **HTTPS access**, you **must** use the HTTP-based URL:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
  ```
If you don’t use the correct URL type (SSH or HTTPS), the script will ask for your password in the terminal.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
We recommend using a virtual environment for a clean setup. Here’s how you can do it on Arch Linux:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
For other OS users—Google is your friend! 😄

### Step 3: Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
```bash
python auto_git_gui.py
```

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use the Script

### 🗝️ Method 1: SSH Access
1. Ensure your GitHub account's SSH key is set up.
2. Place your private SSH key in `~/.config/ssh/id_rsa`.
3. In the script UI, choose the SSH method, and you're ready to roll!

### 🔐 Method 2: HTTPS Access
1. Choose HTTPS in the script UI.
2. Enter your GitHub username and either your password or a personal access token.
   - (*Pro tip*: Tokens are safer than passwords. Learn how to create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).)

## 🧭 Key Features
- **Track All Changes:** Detect additions, deletions, or updates with ease.
- **Push with a Click:** No more terminal gymnastics.
- **Simple and Basic:** Designed for efficiency without the bloat.

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings!
- **Clone First:** Always clone your repo before using this tool. It won't create a new repo for you.
- **Repo Selection:** Double-check the repo path in the UI. Picking the wrong one means no backup—ouch! 😬

This version clarifies that the SSH/HTTPS URL requirement is specific to the **user's own repository**, not the GitHub-Made-Simple project. Let me know if this works!
