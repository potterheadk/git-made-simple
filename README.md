## 🧑‍💻 How to Use the Script

### 🗝️ Method 1: SSH Access
1. Ensure your GitHub account's SSH key is set up.
2. Place your private SSH key in `~/.config/ssh/id_rsa`.
3. In the script UI, choose the SSH method, and you're ready to roll!

### 🔐 Method 2: HTTPS Access
1. Choose HTTPS in the script UI.
2. Enter your GitHub username and either your password or a personal access token.
   - (*Pro tip*: Tokens are safer than passwords. Learn how to create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).)
